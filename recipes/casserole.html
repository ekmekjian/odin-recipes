    <p>I created this Mexican ground beef casserole when I wanted something different that I could make ahead if I wanted to. Double the recipe for company!</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup saled butter</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package cornbread stuffing mix (such as Kraft® Stove Top®)</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with jalapeno</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (8.75 ounce) can sweet corn, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>While the beef is cooking, make stuffing. Bring water and butter to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in stuffing mix; cover. Remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
        <li>Stir diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce into the beef mixture. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add corn and Cheddar cheese. 
            <br>Simmer until cheese is melted completely, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish. Spread cornbread stuffing evenly over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
